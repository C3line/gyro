alias:
  #   The template named 'android-java' was originally just named `android`
  #   and was written in Java before Kotlin even existed.
  #
  #   So this alias exists mainly for compatibility reasons, so that people
  #   who used `-t android` in previous versions of `gyro` can still continue
  #   to do so and that this new update of gyro doesn't break their setup.
  android: android-java
  #   It happens that the `swift3` template is also compatible with Swift 4 without any change.
  #   So we can use the same template for both Swift 3 and Swift 4
  swift4: swift3
