android-java

=== Note ===

  The template named 'android-java' was originally just named `android`
  and was written in Java before Kotlin even existed.

  So this alias exists mainly for compatibility reasons, so that people
  who used `-t android` in previous versions of `gyro` can still continue
  to do so and that this new update of gyro doesn't break their setup.
